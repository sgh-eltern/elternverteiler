* Assign roles via form
* Double-check security
* Can we build an audit trail?
* View: Grouped by class, _how many_ parents are unreachable by eMail?
* View: Group list of Sch√ºler by class (only in the view)
* Some roles are being delegated from the Elternbeirat, and not from the class (e.g. Schulkonferenz). For those, do not record the class where the parent is having this role for, or at least do not show it (in `to_s` etc)
